Sub-Blocks and Improved Confirmed Transactions Propagation
==========================

Motivation
----------

Currently, a block is generated every two minutes on average, and confirmed transactions are propagated along with 
other block sections. 

This is not efficient at all. Most of new block's transactions are already available in a node's mempool, and 
bottlenecking network bandwidth after two minutes of delay is also downgrading network performance.
